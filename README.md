# tomsmith.design
This is the personal portfolio site for Tom Smith. Why did I decide to code this website? Just to show that I can do it, really. Wordpress or Webflow may have been easier, but I really want to drive home the notion that I'm a full-stack creative. I mean, I can design, write, market, animate, and code--what's not to love?

I'm using Hugo for my CMS, Tailwind for styling, Flowbite for starter components, and the site is deployed via Netlify.
