<p class="text-gunmetal">So, you’ve got an idea for the next big thing, and you think you’ve got the perfect name. But have you checked all of your boxes? Follow these steps to make sure your “perfect name” doesn’t shoot you in the foot before you’ve left the gate.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">1. Is the name trademarked by someone else?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Does someone else have legal ownership of your business name? Think of this as a pre-flight check; if somebody else owns the trademark for your would-be name, then it’s a non-starter. You can use the <a class="text-primary-500" href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)</a> website to search for your business name for free. Note that your name may come up as “dead” or “abandoned” (in which case, you’re good to go), but if it’s listed as “active,” you’ll need to revisit the drawing board.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">2. Is the web domain available?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Okay, so your name isn’t trademarked, but is the URL available? You can use domain registrars like <a class="text-primary-500" href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GoDaddy</a> to search for your business name. If it’s available, scoop it up right away! You don’t need to tie your soul to it… you can get it for a year or even month-to-month, but either way, you’ll prevent it from falling into someone else’s hands.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Now, there are some asterisks here. If the “.com” is taken, you can always go with an alternate top-level domain like “.co” or “.io.” But just know that “.com” is still the reigning champ when it comes to top-level domains. Many of the other ones just never really took off (looking at you, “.ninja”). And if your target audience is over 40, definitely hold out for the “.com.”</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Also, if somebody else owns the “.com” and you go with “.co,” for example, just know that you’ll be facing an uphill SEO battle. And people are liable to type in the wrong URL when trying to find you.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">In short, “.com” is still the Kleenex of the tech world.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">3. Is it easy to spell? Or at least sound out?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Overly complicated words, long words, words with silent letters, and fictional words get misspelled. This isn’t such a problem if you’re just going to flood the zone with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, but if you’re in the majority, you’ll need customers to be able to spell your name to find you.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">The solution? Use a recognizable word, or series of simple, recognizable words for your business name. If you insist on using a made-up word, make sure people can sound it out phonetically.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Some notable exceptions to this rule include “Lyft” and “Chipotle.” The former is a clear misspelling of “lift,” and as for the latter, we all have that one aunt who pronounces it “Chi-pottle.” However, “Lyft” is simple enough to be memorable and compensate for its spelling. Chipotle is all brick-and-mortar locations… so people just need to recognize it on the highway, not spell it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">4. Are the social media handles available?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Social media is just as important as a website nowadays. Some businesses bypass a website altogether and just have a Facebook page or an Instagram account. Make sure, at least, that the handles for the platforms that are important to your industry are available.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">For example, if you’re a fashion brand, you should definitely have Instagram and Pinterest. X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook are perhaps less important.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">If handles are taken on other, non-imperative platforms, it’s not the end of the world. But make sure the accounts owned by other people aren’t posting offensive content, or content that your audience would otherwise be turned off by.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">5. Is the entity name available in your state?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">If you’re a freelancer/sole proprietor, this checkbox isn’t as important. But if you’re planning on going the whole nine yards, be sure that the entity (LLC, Partnership, etc.) is available in your state or territory. You can do a quick search on sites like <a class="text-primary-500" href="https://www.legalzoom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LegalZoom</a> or <a class="text-primary-500" href="https://www.tailorbrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tailor Brands</a>.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">But if you’ve passed the four prior checks, then chances are that this one will be available too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gunmetal">And that’s it!</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Of course, there are other factors to consider when naming a business. Search volume, resonance with your audience… things like that. Think of the checks above as prerequisites to ensure the spaceship can take off. Everything else is just about how fast it can go.</p>
