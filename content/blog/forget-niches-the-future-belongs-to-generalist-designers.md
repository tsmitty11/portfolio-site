<p class="text-gunmetal">For the past decade, people have been telling me to ‘niche down’. Blogs, wanna-be gurus, the industry itself… everybody was saying to niche down or fade away. Well, in 2025, that advice feels delightfully outdated. AI is changing what’s expected of designers, eroding the banks of specialties and subsets, and creating the expectation that designers serve as ‘creative pillars’ rather than cogs in a bloated pipeline. While the practice of occupying a specific industry (e.g., blockchain, insurance, e-commerce) may still be sage wisdom, the days of calling yourself a ‘UX designer’ are coming to a close.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">The rise and fall of specialists</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">When I was at university, Graphic Design was still the dominant fixture in the Communication Arts department, but there was a seemingly endless array of design offshoots being offered as alternate majors or minors. User Experience, Service Design, Motion Media, Interaction Design, Packaging Design… the list goes on. It was where the industry was headed at the time, and there was enough work in each discipline to satiate the appetite of the ambitious creatives graduating from these programs.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">In recent years, a few of those disciplines have become behemoths in their own right—particularly User Experience and Service Design. Business consultants in the front, creatives in the back. They’ve been hailed as royalty in our increasingly digital world, surpassing even programmers in the hierarchical pecking order.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">But tides are shifting, and no discipline is immune from the specter of AI. Are we entering a new era in which designers are just designers again—sans the prefix?</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">AI is eating away at the scope of every position in the creative industry</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">AI can do an afternoon’s worth of competitive research in seconds. It can audit a web page and provide UX recommendations, or rearrange design frameworks into functioning web apps and landing pages. It can do a million other things that encroach on the day-to-days of each and every person in the creative industry.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">So with that being said, is there really the same need for specialists? Will businesses want to piece-meal a design team together and pay individually for UX designers, product designers, and motion designers? I think not. I think the future of the design industry belongs to the generalists—‘jacks of all trades,’ capable of taking products from concept to shipment and wielding AI to augment their output along the way.</p>

<p class="text-gunmetal">It’s like a cobblestone road. Each stone represents a different creative discipline (UX, motion design, web development, etc.). A generalist designer will have at least a small stone for each… and AI is the sand that gets poured into the crevices in between, bridging those skill gaps and yielding a smooth path forward.</p>
