The world is moving faster than ever, and with that, marketing teams are needing creative one-stop shops who can churn out assets and bring their campaigns to life as efficiently as possible.

Tom Smith, a Creative Director, Designer, and SCAD alumni has found his niche as a secret weapon for CMOs, marketing managers, and growth hackers. As a true ‘Jack-of-All-Trades’, Tom’s been able to bring high-minded, ‘head-in-the-clouds’ creative ambitions to life quickly, and with the stunning quality.

Here’s a few examples of how Tom’s been changing the game for marketing teams around the world.

## He’s a true one-stop shop, providing marketers with access to design, animation, video production, and web development 

Piece-mealing freelancers together by way of Upwork and Fiverr is cool, but what if one contractor satiated all of your creative needs? 

Tom Smith wields a truly unmatched grasp over every aspect of the modern creative industry. Need display ads and social graphics? Done. Need an attention-grabbing animation for stories or reels? Also done. Need a targeted landing page designed, developed, and deployed from scratch? Also, also done.

Tom’s so versatile, they should change the nomenclature to “Tom-of-All-Trades”.

## Tom Smith is an in-house developer for marketing teams

If there’s two groups of people that almost never see eye-to-eye, it’s marketers and developers. Maybe it’s a right-brain/left-brain sort of thing, but for whatever reason, they might as well be snakes and mongooses. 

Tom’s been saving marketers from having to explain their vision to an engineer. And from seeing their request forcibly retired to the bottom of a congested list of ‘higher-priority’ tickets.

Not only can Tom make his way around your existing Wordpress or Webflow site, he’s also a full-stack developer who can design and develop websites and landing pages from scratch– often inside a single day! 

Plus, he’s not going to be bamboozled when you request button triggers for tag manager or dedicated conversion success pages. Save yourself from infuriating engineer exchanges in 2026 and hire Tom Smith instead.

## Tom focuses on making design assets accessible and editable

Does Tom Smith think it would be great if the entire world ran on Adobe? Of course. But that’s not the reality. Adobe is expensive, especially at a multi-seat level for casual users (aka marketing teams).

Luckily, Figma and Canva exist. Tom’s been using browser-based tools with optional free tiers to ensure that marketing teams have company-wide ‘edit-access’ to their deliverables. 

With Figma, for example, Tom can set up social graphics with auto-layouts so that marketers can edit copy and export at their leisure. Figma also enables them to duplicate artboards, make small adjustments, and then produce entirely new assets with limited churn.

Tom believes that creative assets should not only be beautiful, but also practical and usable.

## Having Tom on retainer gives marketing teams ‘quick-draw’ capabilities to capitalize on social trends

Taylor Swift’s affinity for Ranch Dressing was a reference with a short shelf life– but it was topical and funny for the teams who took the bone and ran with it.

If you see a funny reference that’s going to become stale by the time the sun goes down, then you need someone who can make magic happen at the drop of a hat.

When you work with Tom Smith, magic is just a Slack message away.

## Your deliverables stay on-brand across all channels

The problem with piece-mealing freelancers from Upwork and Fiverr is that the deliverables tend to be inconsistent. Sure, they might use your fonts and colors… but that’s where the adherence to your brand stops. That’s where you start to see random gradients, inconsistent header sizing, random illustrations, off-brand photography… the list goes on.

And when you have an inconsistent brand, you lose trust amongst your audience. Even if they can’t pinpoint specifically what is inconsistent, their brain still knows that something is just “off”.

When you have someone like Tom Smith handling creative across all marketing channels, you have brand consistency everywhere. That way, your audience knows it’s you even before they see your logo.

## Make 2026 the year you supercharge your marketing team with a bad-ass, do-anything designer

Tom Smith is available for retainer agreements. Get 40 hours per month for $3,000 USD (per month).

Again, that’s for world-class design, animation, web development, brand adherence, company-wide editability, etc. Compare that to the cost of piece-mealing freelancers from across the web– not just the labor cost itself, but the cost of your time in vetting them, the cost of squashed/unusable assets, freelancer turnover.

The TLDR is that Tom saves you time, money, and headaches. 

I never know how to end blog posts eloquently, so just make like Vin Diesel and inject some NOS into your 2026 marketing budget. 

Cheers.
