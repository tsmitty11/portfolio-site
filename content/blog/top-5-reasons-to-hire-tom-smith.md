<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">1. Tom Smith is an evergreen talent; as valuable in 10 years as he is today.</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Since graduating from Savannah College of Art and Design almost a decade ago, Tom leveraged his affinity for learning to amass an arsenal of creative skills and business acumen. He’s taught himself how to code, how to animate motion graphics, and he’s learned the ins-and outs-of digital marketing. Additionally, his startup experience has bestowed him with an intimate understanding of business operations–which has bolstered the real-world effectiveness of his result-driven creative endeavors. As we are living in the age of AI, Tom has stayed up-to-date with the ever-growing list of available generative tools. He chooses to embrace AI and finds ways for it to augment his creative and development processes.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">2. He is a True “Jack of All Trades”, capable of supporting the entire creative pipeline.</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Tom can design, code, animate, write copy, wield digital marketing tools, and more. He can occupy any cog within the modern creative pipeline, and there are few people who can build your brand, design your UI, develop your tech, write your content, animate your social media posts, and effectively market your business to the end consumer. Tom’s multi-faceted capabilities have prompted such glowing remarks as “where did you find this guy?!”, and “I’m never starting a business without a creative team again!”. As mentioned earlier, Tom loves to learn–and that love for learning has made him a force to be reckoned with. If maximizing your “value-to-hire” ratio is important to you, then surely checking off design, marketing, development, and content creation with one hire will be one of the best decisions you make this year.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">3. Tom has the hands-on skills to take on the sweat equity, but also the leadership to scale a creative team.</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Tom has been the sole designer/creative mind in many a scrappy startup, leveraging his wide array of creative skills to tackle whatever tasks and challenges come his way. But he’s also an empathetic and decisive leader who has led several teams of interns, contractors, and employees throughout his career. He prides himself in his introspective and collaborative approach to management and leadership. Tom is a patient but effective teacher, enabling him to guide newer designers and drive them to push the envelope with their creative output.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">4. Tom has extensive experience in bridging inter-departmental communication gaps.</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">While his diverse skill-set is great for his own output, it also empowers him to effectively communicate with other departments and disciplines. His background in web development yields productive meetings with engineers, speaking in pragmatic engineering terms rather than fluffy design rhetoric. His experience in client management management has taught him how to effectively sell creative concepts to C-suite executives and external clients, translating creative ideation into terms built upon tangible business goals. He is also an exceptional communicator, both written and verbal, and has a remarkable ability to distill complex concepts into something that’s more easy to digest.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">5. End-to-end implementation is Tom’s super power; he’s skilled in taking complex projects from concept to execution.</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Tom’s core understanding along each touch point of the creative pipeline enables him to take projects straight-through from concept to execution. Need to launch a new brand and test its viability with a landing page? Tom’s got you. Need to design, build, and deploy an app MVP? Tom’s got that too. Need to build 20 subsidiary brands to target niche audiences? *Drum roll* You guessed it!—Tom’s got you. Throughout his career, Tom has leveraged his diverse skill-set to solve complex problems and move mountains for CEOs, founders, and visionaries. If someone needs to land a plane on Main Street, Tom’s the one who’ll figure out how to do it. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gunmetal">Are you ready to level-up your team and hire Tom Smith?</h2>

<p class="text-gunmetal">Tom is on the market and is actively fielding new opportunities. He’s best suited for venture studios, boutique marketing firms, small-to-midsize startups, and he is open to co-founding opportunities. If you’re ready to amplify your team’s output and get multiple birds with one stone, then you’re ready to hire Tom Smith today!</p>
