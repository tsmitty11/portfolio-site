overview: "Would you believe that I illustrated 366 of these guys!? These were made for an Australian ecommerce company that sold... you guessed it!... ants! They wanted an icon for every species of ant that they carried for use on their website and packaging. This was one of my earlier freelance projects, but it remains one of my favorite. Not just because of how well they turned out, but because of what a unique brief this was!"

background: "The client wanted to use these icons on their website, as well as their packaging. They provided me with a spreadsheet containing the scientific names for each ant and a few illustration examples that resonated with them in terms of style. I began by sourcing images for each ant to use as reference, and then drafted the first few and ran them by the client for approval. Once I had the go-ahead, I got to work on the daunting task of illustrating the other ~300 or so ants."
challenge: "The challenge here was finding a good balance between quality and efficiency, so as not to lose (too much) money on this job. Of course, I could have spent six months meticuously illustrating these ants, but would not have been financially practical. So, I noted similarities across the different ant species (furry versus shiny, long atenas versus short antenas, eye shape, and so forth) and created repeatable patterns and shapes that could be used for each instance. I would change the colors, overall shape, and defining characteristics of each ant, but I had this library of 'patterns' that I could draw from to expedite the process as much as possible. They still forver to complete, as one would expect, but ultimately I love the way they turned out... and so did the client!"
