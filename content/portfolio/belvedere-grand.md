background: "When my girlfriend and I were living in the Upper Peninsula or Michigan for a Summer, she was bartending at a local inn that had just recently changed hands. I would stop by to keep Olivia company every now again, and on one such occasion, I struck up a conversation with the new owner. She told me her ambitions for upgrading the establishment and her desire to give it a more 'luxurious' facelift. Inspired, I went home a drafted something akin to what you see above. I sent her my idea, and she loved it! We ran with the concept and proceeded to draft a suite of brand deliverables to transform The Belvedere Grand into a jewel of the Upper Peninsula."
challenge: "The clientele prior to the re-brand were vacationers and ATV'ers in the Summer, and fishermen and snowmobilers in the Winter. The logo had to convey a high-end option for the area, without alienating the customer base that had kept it in business up to this point. The chosen typeface conveys larger-than-life luxury, but the thin, whispy characters and silhouette of a goat keep it grounded in 'UP-authenticity'."
