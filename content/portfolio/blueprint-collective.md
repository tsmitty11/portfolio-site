background: "The Total Synergy team wanted to spin up this brand as an educational pillar to the parent company. They came up with the 'Blueprint Collective' name (a reference to the architecture industry) and I took it from there. I used grid motifs, lots of blues, and masking tape textures to try and embody the 'drafting' aesthetic as much as possible."
challenge: "As with any subsidiary brand development, the challenge lies in making it cohesive to the parent brand without deviating too far from 'true North'. I borrowed the brand typeface from Total Synergy, as well as some colors... giving greater emphasis to the blues and introducing new additions such as the neon yellow/green. The grid/masking tape elements were added as a tie-in to the blueprint motif, as well as to introduce some textural variety."
