overview: "Canopy was a desktop app developed by Homebrew creator Max Howell that offered real-time notifications for GitHub.

background: "Max asked me for an icon. He didn't provide many exmaples or guidelines, just a basic overview of what the app would do--thus, I had a great deal of creative freedom. I wanted the icon to minimaalistic, simple, and memorable. The functionality of the app was simple (but necessary) and so I wanted to the design to match. I went a little 'on the nose', admittedly, with the imagery of a literal canopy... but in ths case, I thought it appropriate. The name 'Canopy' came the fact that the app enabled users to 'everything', so why not show that? The green color was inspired by green text message bubbles. I felt as though drawing inspiration fro the functionaly Canopy was attempting to bring to GitHub would help solidify the use-case for Canopy in the minds of users."
challenge: "The app was simple and straight-forward in functionality, with no UI through which to flesh out a more comprehensive brand aesthetic. Thus, the icon needed to say a lot with a just a little. Everyone was happy with the end result... it said what it intended to say, and achieved its goal of be a 'damn good' app icon."
