background: "Max asked me for an icon. He didn't provide many examples or guidelines, just a basic overview of what the app would do—so I had a great deal of creative freedom. I wanted the icon to be minimalistic, simple, and memorable. The functionality of the app was simple (but necessary), and I wanted the design to match. I went a little 'on the nose', admittedly, with the imagery of a literal canopy... but in this case, I thought it was appropriate. The name 'Canopy' came from the idea that the app enabled users to 'see everything', so why not show that? The green color was inspired by green text message bubbles. I felt that drawing inspiration from the functionality Canopy was bringing to GitHub would help solidify its use case in the minds of users."
challenge: "The app was simple and straightforward in functionality, with no UI through which to flesh out a more comprehensive brand aesthetic. Thus, the icon needed to say a lot with just a little. Everyone was happy with the end result... it said what it intended to say and achieved its goal of being a 'damn good' app icon."
