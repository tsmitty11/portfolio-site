They're one of my favorite things to design because each one is like a little illustration. So, in honor of all things iconography, I've currated some of my favorite sets from over the years for your enjoyment."

background: "Above, you'll see a set of ant icons, robot-themed icons for a 9gag-esc media site, achivement badges for an secret shopper platform, and an minimalistic set for an engineering platform. Quite the variety if I do say so myself! I have a soft spot for the ants--they were one of my first independent freelance projects, and they took absolutely forever to finish!"
challenge: "The challenge with icons is that they say what need to say (they shouldn't be supurfluous to the written text) and they all need to have an equal visual impact. That means really thinking about each and every mark you make, while also paying close attention to line weights, color choices, and the how the icons present next to each other."
