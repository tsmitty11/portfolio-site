overview: "I finally broke down and taught myself AfterEffects a few months ago. As social media becomes more and more inundated with content, it's become imperative to capture peoples' attention with the power of motion. I've been having a ton of fun with it! Having dabbled in animation back when I was a teenager, the concept has come somewhat easily to me. It's a blast to see designs really come to life. Above are a few motion graphics I've done for various clients. If you like what you see, get in touch and let's and bring your vision to life."

background: "The animations above were done for Tidus Wallet and tea Protocol (both web3 projects). Tea had a pretty slick and techy brand guide, but I had a bit more latitude with Tidus to bring in fun meme characters and soundtracks (see Tidus Games). All of these samples were used on YouTube, as well as social media."
challenge: "The learning curve to AfterEffects has been the biggest hurtle in producing animated content. I started with a Udemy course, and once I learned the basics, it was pretty easy to get a feel for the UI and start playing around with different functionalities and effects. The other tricky aspect of motion graphics is that revisions become a bit more difficult; there's something of a horrifying butterfly effect when making changes to complex animations, and so getting organized with my layers and sequences has been essential to me not pulling my hair out.
