background: "I'm an artist at heart. My personal projects are where I really get to spread my creative wings. While you won't find slick UIs or snappy promo animations on this page, my personal work is a fantastic window into who I am as a designer and as an artist."
challenge: "The challenge with personal work is, well, finding time to do personal work! At the end of a busy day, it's sometimes difficult to find the motivation to create even more... kind of like a chef getting off a shift and eating Hot Pockets. But when I do get around to creating my own stuff, I quickly remember how much fun it can be. Furthermore, in the age of AI, I feel as though personal projects are an integral part of creatives retaining their individual 'voice'."
