overview: "Alaeris was a web3/blockchain initiative that I co-founded back in 2021 aimed at offsetting carbon emissions and empowering global communities by incentivizing the planting of trees. The project unfortunately never amounted to anything (we attempted bootstrapping the company right as Crypto Winter was taking shape), but it was certainly fun to work on. I served as 'Chief Creative Officer' and helped staff a creative team via Upwork and AngelList (now Wellfound). I also ideated the name 'Alaeris', finalized the logo design, developed an executive summary and pitch deck, and drafted technical illustrations."

background: "When the founder/CEO reached out to me on Upwork and pitched the idea, I was immediately sold. I had been looking for a segway into blockchain for a while, and the opportunity to do so while also helping the environment seemed too good to pass up. We got to work and began fleshing out ideas for how it might work. The idea was that users would purchase NFTs representing physical acreage around the globe. Those proceeds would be used to remunerate workers in developing countries in exchange for planting trees, and the NFTs could be used as proof of carbon offset. I led the brainstorming work that resulted in the name 'Alaeris'. It's actually a combination of a Swahili word and a Spanish word, put together to create one memorable name that translated to 'Air Tool'."
challenge: "As with any startup, the number one challenge was acquiring funding. I helped develop our pitch deck and executive summary, along with a suite of technical illustrations explaining our vision. We pitched to several investors and were getting some positive feedback, but then the market crashed and the appetite for web3-related projects just wasn't there.All in all, it was a fun challenge and I met some amazing folks along the way."
