overview: "I worked with tea.xyz (now tea Protocol) from 2022 to 2024. What you see above is collateral that represents the the company's aesthetic prior to a 2023 rebrand that we did. The old branding was gritty and dev-centric, built on the foundation of slick Swiss design sensibilities. We utilized a challenging visual grid system (I say 'challenging' because I had to develop the website), bright colors against a dark theme background, and generative AI imagery. This was just before ChatGPT and other AI tools took the world by storm. Image generators like Dall*e and Sable Diffusion were still producing fairly 'wonky' renderings--so much so that we actually used their imperfections as part of the brand aesthetic. As the principal creative person on the team, I had the opportunity to embark on several 'side quests', such as designing comic book covers for an NFT series and making tea'm hoodies. The re-brand was necessary after a corporate restructuring, but dang do I like the 'look and feel' we had going here."

background: "Let me walk you through what you're looking at above. I designed that hoodie for team members and the attendees of an open-house held at the then headquarters in San Juan. I used a proprietary AI prompt that we used for our on-site image generations to create different design elements that I brought together in Illustrator. You'll see a couple of print design examples, the aforementioned comic book cover (I did the layout and design... can't take credit for the illustration), and then a landing page design that really exemplifies the many facets of this forward-thinking brand language."
challenge: "Three words: Visual. Grid. System. It was cool looking and fit the developer-centric aesthetic, but typographic designs were plain difficult due to the size of the grid cells, and developing responsive web pages was the stuff of nightmares (everything sized with 'vw/vh' and media queries out the wazoo... just take a look at my GitHub contributions towards the end of 2022)."
