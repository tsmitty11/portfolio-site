background: "Tidus is a relatively new crypto wallet, and they wanted to launch these games in order to drive engagement. We started with the animated video (my favorite part of this project) to build excitement on social media. Then we moved on to the landing page, got that up and running, and finally fleshed out a suite of marketing graphics for social media and paid advertising."
challenge: "As with any startup, Tidus had a quick deadline to launch the games. I had to find spots in the process where I could make 'quick-wins' in regards to efficiency. I couldn't find many shortcuts for the video animation, but for the landing page, I started with a component library and made small modifications to fit the Tidus brand. I used Figma for the marketing collateral so enable anyone on the team to come in and add comment, add copy, or export assets as needed."
