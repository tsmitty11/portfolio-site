overview: "The Tidus Games are a Roman-themed airdrop event held by Tidus Wallet/NYCrypto. Users can sign in with their crypto wallet and complete tasks in-app in exchange for points, which are tracked on-chain. I animated a promotional video, designed the landing page, made the necessary UI additions to the mobile app, and developed a suite of marketing collateral."

background: "Tidus is a relatively new crypto wallet, and they wanted to launch these games to drive engagement. We started with the animated video (my favorite part of the project) to build excitement on social media. Then we moved on to the landing page, got that up and running, and finally fleshed out a suite of marketing graphics for social media and paid advertising."
challenge: "As with any startup, Tidus had a quick deadline to launch the games. I had to find spots in the process where I could make 'quick wins' in terms of efficiency. I couldn't find many shortcuts for the video animation, but for the landing page, I started with a component library and made small modifications to fit the Tidus brand. I used Figma for the marketing collateral to enable anyone on the team to come in, add comments, make copy edits, or export assets as needed."
