background: "Total Synergy approached me after a brand-revamp, needing to extend the new 'look-and-feel' to encompass all of their advertising and marketing collateral (eBooks, display ads, social media, blog images, etc.). They were in the process of moving away from the typical 'SaaS-aesthetic' and more towards something high-end that would appeal to customers with a 'designer's eye'."
challenge: "Their 20-page brand guide was designed primarily with the website design in mind. Expanding the brand to include an extensive array of marketing deliverables required careful experimentation to ensure that we pushed the 'visual envelope' while staying true to the brand's core visual principals. I served as a one-man creative powerhouse for the marketing department, producing everything from display ads to motion graphics to benchmark reports. Collaborating with stakeholders across drastically different timezones proved challenging as well. To combat communication breakdowns, we designed most assets in Figma. This enabled both real-time and asynchronous collaboration, as well as editing capabilities for each and every team member."
