background: "tea Protocol's brand was very streamlined, techy, and minimal. The wanted the Universi'tea to logo to draw inspiration from its parent brand, while also feeling as though it could exist in its own universe. We drew inspiration from traditional university seals, as well as classic Englic tea bags. We isolated motifs from the tea brand to be used as iconography within the logomark, and combined the university seal concept with the tag/label found on a tea bag. The wordmark is set in 'Fira Code'... as node to developers and a tie-back to the techy feeling of the parent brand. Finally, we set the 'powered by tea' statement below the logo to solidify a nice clean association."
challenge: "Designing a subsidiary brand is always challenging. You need to make it feel coheisive to the parent brand, but not so much so to the point that it feels like a copy and paste. With the Universi'tea brand, I feel as though we were succesful in striking the pefect balance."
