overview: "What would a developer's terminal look like in the form of a gui (graphic user interface)? That's the question we asked ourselves when designing PKGX's visual package manager, now called the OSSAPP. The goal was to create an app that would empower anyone to to install and manage open-source software. Users are able to visually browse open-source that's available on PKGX, install and uninstall, manage versions, interact with an in-app terminal (and gui when available), and much more. I led all aspects of the design, owned the prompt engineering for AI-generated package imagery, and assisted with the frontend development. Uniquely, every component was 100% designed from scratch."

background: "The OSSAPP was originally developed under tea.xyz before being re-branded to OSSAPP (Open-Source Software App) under PKGX, and it's now one of PKGX's flagship products. Internally, we simply called it the 'gui'. The terminal is such a powerful tool that everyone has access to, but only seasoned developers know how to wield. We wanted to bring casual users into the fold and introduced open-source to a wider user-base. In effort to assign a visual identity to these pieces of code which previously only existed as such, I developed a custom AI-prompt and we engineered an automation to generate a graphic cover for each package when added to PKGX. We launched on ProductHunt and were were instantly lauded by the developer community. Users praised the UI in particular, citing that it was refreshing to see something not made form cookie-cutter components."
challenge: "We wanted the gui to look like the visual embodiment of a terminal, hence we built all of the components from scratch. I went for squared-off corners, bright ANSI colors against a charcoal background, and crisp gray borders separating components and sections. I affectionately liken it to the Millennium Falcon (from Start Wars) in that it felt 'hobbled-together' in a beautifully functional and bootstrapped way. With that being said, creating all of the components from scratch presented a unique challenge, both from design and development standpoints. We ended up deciding to use Svelte for the app because it enabled us to bring over HTML partials from our then website, which was built with Hugo. Each and every component in the app is built from the ground app, variant states and all."
